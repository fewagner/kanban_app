# Changelog

All notable, user-visible changes. The app shows a one-time notice when the
version changes; the details live here.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-10-10

- Fixed: right after an update the app could stay blank for up to ten minutes,
  because the browser combined new files with cached ones of the previous
  version — reloading did not help. Every version now loads from its own
  addresses.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-10

- **Formatted notes.** The notes box of a card has a formatting bar: headings,
  **bold**, *italic*, underline, strikethrough, seven text colours (legible in
  the light and the dark theme), bulleted and numbered lists, quotes, links and
  dividing lines, plus "clear formatting". Ctrl/⌘+B, I, U and K work as
  shortcuts. The notes show formatted while you edit — no markup to type.
- Pasting from a web page, Word or Google Docs keeps bold, italic, lists and
  the like but leaves out fonts, sizes and colours outside the palette, so what
  you see is exactly what gets saved.
- Notes are still plain Markdown in the data repository (with a few inline
  tags for underline and colours), and a note is only rewritten when someone
  actually edits it.
- Comments use the same, nicer typography.
- Search ignores formatting: searching for "color" no longer finds every
  coloured note.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-10

From the second round of client feedback.

- **Repeating to-dos are ticked per iteration.** Ticking one iteration used to
  tick the whole series; now each iteration has its own tick, so ticking this
  Monday leaves next Monday open. Notes and comments stay shared by the whole
  series.
- **Every iteration shows its own date.** The weekday columns show the
  iterations of the current week — a daily to-do appears in all seven columns,
  each chip with its own day — instead of the series' first date everywhere. A
  ticked iteration stays visible, struck through, until Sunday; a missed one
  stays red until Sunday; on Monday the new week starts fresh. Series without an
  iteration this week show their next one.
- **Tick to-dos right on the card**: one click on ☐ in the list view, no editor
  needed. A second click opens it again.
- The editor names the iteration you opened ("Wiederholung vom …"), the done box
  reads "Erledigt am …", and the date field is labelled as the first date of the
  series.
- **End time**: a dated card can have an optional end time next to its start
  (*von 09:30 bis 10:15*). The day and week view of the calendar and the cards in
  the list view show the full span; the month grid keeps just the start.
- Safer dragging: a weekly or fortnightly series dragged to another weekday moves
  as a whole; dropping a series on one of your own lists is refused instead of
  silently deleting its repetition and ticks.
- The "overdue" filter now means the same as the red colour: past to-dos that
  are not ticked off. Past appointments no longer count as overdue.
- Fixed: a "weekdays" series whose first date fell on a weekend could show that
  weekend day as its next iteration.

A `done: true` that an earlier version wrote on a repeating to-do (meaning "the
whole series") is ignored, as that was exactly the bug.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-30

From the first round of client feedback.

- **Archive**: every card now has an *Archive* button. Archived cards leave the
  board and the calendar without being deleted, and gather on a new third page
  **Archive**, grouped by the month they were due (newest first, undated last).
  *Reactivate* brings a card back exactly as it was — date, labels and comments
  included — so nothing has to be re-created because it was archived by mistake.
  Single cards can be deleted permanently, and *Empty the archive* clears
  everything at once; both ask first.
- **Week and day views in the calendar**, next to the month grid. ‹ and › move
  by one month, week or day depending on the mode. Week and day give each date a
  tall column with room for the client name.
- **Colour codes for lists**: the ⋯ menu on a column header offers eight preset
  colours, a free colour picker and *No colour*. The colour shows as a bar above
  the heading and a light wash behind the column — the weekday columns can be
  coloured too.
- **Overdue to-dos are red, to-dos due today are yellow**, automatically.
  Completed to-dos and appointments are never coloured.
- **Info cards are notes now**: no delivery date and no urgency. Instead they
  can be **pinned**, which keeps them at the top of their list whatever the
  sorting says. An info card always lives in one of your own lists; switching a
  card to Info removes its date.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-02

First prototype.

- **Lists view**: seven built-in weekday columns — a card with a delivery date
  automatically sits in the column of its weekday — plus your own lists for
  cards without a date. Columns are reordered by dragging their header, cards
  are moved by dragging them to another column (dropping on a weekday keeps the
  card in its own week and only changes the day).
- **Calendar view**: month grid with seven weekday columns, one row per calendar
  week and the ISO week number in the gutter. Only appointments are shown by
  default; the filter can add info and to-do cards. Repeating cards appear on
  every occurrence.
- **Cards** with title, delivery date (mandatory unless *no date* is ticked),
  optional time, repetition (daily, weekdays, weekly, every two weeks, monthly,
  yearly, with an optional end date), the three labels *category* /
  *urgency* / *client*, free Markdown text, creation date and author.
  To-do cards can be marked completed; completed cards are struck through,
  sorted last and can be hidden in the filter.
- **Comments** per card, each its own file so concurrent commenting never
  conflicts.
- **Employees**: creating a card or a comment always asks who you are; the name
  is stored and shown. The list of employees is set in the settings.
- **Clients** with a color, shown next to the card title in the calendar.
- **Filter** (category, urgency, client, author, date range, hide completed),
  **sort** (date, urgency, category, client, title, creation date, ascending or
  descending) and **search** over title and free text.
- **German and English** interface, switchable in the top bar.
- **Data in your own git repository**: one repository per board, Markdown plus a
  small YAML config, connected with a fine-grained access token. Every save is
  one commit; saving pulls and merges three-way first. Several boards per
  browser, invite links, and a `?demo=1` mode with sample data.
